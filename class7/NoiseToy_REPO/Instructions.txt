don't modify the makefiles in this folder! they are set for different programmers that you may use. 

INSTRUCTIONS:

Open Terminal and run the setup command (change the path to the current directory). Then run the corresponding command to program a noise toy.


SETUP:

Switch to current directory: in Terminal, type "cd " (with a space after "cd") and then drag the current folder into the Terminal window to autocomplete the path to the directory. Then press return/enter.

cd PATH_TO_THIS_DIRECTORY

Makefile:
make sure you Pick the makefile you need, or modify the code accordingly.
makefile should be called "Makefile" with no file extension, two archived versions are stored in the "makefiles_that_work" folder.

USBtinyISP works as is, no mods needed
for ArduinoasISP, port needs to be specified, so make sure you code in the name of your usb port. (find in terminal with this command: 
ls /dev/cu.*
or just look in your arduino app or drives.

Hardware:
ArduinoasISP may need 3.3v connected to attiny85 manually.

CODE:

In Terminal, run the corresponding "make" command specified below. Copy/paste the line into Terminal, then press return/enter.

if make isn't working, you can try avrdude directly like this:

avrdude -p t85 -c arduino -P COM3 -b 19200 -e -U hfuse:w:0xDF:m -U lfuse:w:0xE2:m -U flash:w:manatee_toy.hex

MANATEES (BLUE):
make project=manatee_toy

BUTTERFLY (YELLOW):
make project=butterfly_v4

ORACLE (GREY):
make project=stereo85plus_toy

BROCCOLI:
make project=broccoli

ORANGE/SUNRISE:
make project=i5_toy_v7

the makefile generates hex from the c file and then removes it.

order of pins:
LtoR
1) reset
2) MOSI
3) MISO
4) SCK
5) GND
