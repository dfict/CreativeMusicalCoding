Regarding Accompaniment
Daniel Fishkin


Materials Required:
synthesizer, stopwatch

Performance Instructions:

This is electronic accompaniment to instrumental solo. Perform long tones on synthesizer, following marked stopwatch durations on the score. At the beginning of piece, sit silently in reverent contemplation and wait until cue from conductor to start stopwatches in unison. During each passage, begin playing at the first time notated and sustain until reaching the second time noted, then stop. For example:

00:54 — 01:05

01:45 — 02:01

Means that a player will start a note at the min/sec 00:54 and hold it for 11 seconds until until 01:05, and then be silent until 01:45, at which point they select another note and hold it for 16 seconds until 02:01.

02:45 — X

02:55 — X 

Means that a player enters playing at 02:45 and stops playing based on intuition, and then enters with the next note at 02:55, for as long as they see fit.


Tuning of the synthesizers is pre-determined. But pitch selection is up to the player. Can be single notes or chords. But pitches should not change during a passage—simply sustain the note.

One need not listen to other parts while performing—focus on the stopwatch and play at the written times.
